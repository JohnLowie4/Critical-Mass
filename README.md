## Work / Project Examples

<a href='https://github.com/JohnLowie4/EmployIn'>EmployIn</a> was a project that was built from scratch that consisted of two other contributing members. EmployIn is an iOS application that streamlines the hiring process for employers and hiring managers. During the development of EmployIn, I was the project manager and team lead. I designed the user story board, and designed and built most of the database tables and the backend framework with PostgreSQL and Express.js. 

As a current Software Developer at <a href='polyfill.cc'>Polyfill Softwares</a>, I help bring designs to life from Figma mockups to beautiful and functional designs on the browser. I work with TypeScript and React to ensure that there are no mutations in our information that are being displayed. I have build the functionalities of comment/reply features of social media apps, user dashboards, and used CRUD api calls for various company projects.

## Inspiration

Ever since I've picked up working with TypeScript, I have been fascinated with how far software development with JavaScript and type syntax can go when it is integrated into the JavaScript interpreter. Currently, the team behind TypeScript has submitted an <a href='https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/a-proposal-for-type-syntax-in-javascript/'>ECMAScript TC39 proposal</a> to add TypeScript as "comments" in JavaScript. This eliminates the requirement that browsers go through when translating TypeScript code into JavaScript. This proposal has inspired me look deeper into working with TypeScript and explore the importance of type syntax in any project that I work with. Type syntax is like a layer of testing before developers start unit testing the product. From my previous experience, variable mutations in large projects without type syntax is very common, and often dangerous. Having type syntax ensures that the developer is accountable for any mutating data, and prevents any future bugs and errors.

## Focus

If I was given the opportunity to learn whatever I want for the first 6 months at CM, I would want to focus my efforts on honing my skills in mobile development with React Native, and then move towards other mobile development languages like Swift, Kotlin, and Dart. I would first start with React Native and learn the nuance differences between iOS devices and Android devices through the styling with css-in-js. I would then move on to learning Dart and using the Flutter framework for building cross platform applications. Afterwards, I'd like to tackle either Swift or Kotlin and learn about how each method of development differs from each other, and which ones are better for specific projects.
